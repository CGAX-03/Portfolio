            <h2>About Me</h2>
                 <p>So, who is Chris? <br><br>

                I’m a young lad, enthusiastic and eager to put in work my skill and knowledge. But let’s talk a little about my story.<br><br>
 
                Born and raised in the country of Mexico, where I lived a nomad’s life, constantly moving from city to city. With guidance I focused my life into fast learning and adaptation. In the year of 2018 a big and difficult challenge was presented to my family, moving to another country, in this case Brazil, it was time to put hands on all of my life-long learned skills. Now a days I continue to live in the country in the city of Sao Paulo and currently coursing College at FIAP, where my main interest is software Developing, I now want to focus my journey into the Front-End realm.</><br><br>
                
                There’s where you come from, I’m interest in comming into your company and share my skill and so continue to improve my experience. With a little co-working I’m sure we can expect great things for the future!</p>
