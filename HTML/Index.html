                Born and raised in the country of Mexico, where I lived a nomad’s life, constantly moving from city to city. With guidance I focused my life into fast learning and adaptation. In the year of 2018 a big and difficult challenge was presented to my family, moving to another country, in this case Brazil, it was time to put hands on, on all of my life-long learned skills. Now a days I continue to live at the country, in the city of Sao Paulo and currently coursing College at FIAP, where my main interest is software Developing. Now, I continue to focus my journey into the realm of Front-End development<br><br>
                
                There’s where you come from, I’m interest in comming into your company and share my skill and so continue to improve my experience. With a little co-working I’m sure we can expect great things for the future!</p>
